      <h2>Some Quick Facts About Koalas</h2>

      <img src="Koala-facts-7.jpg" alt="Adorable Koala!" id="bio-image ">

      <p>Koalas aren't bears as many people are led to believe. They aren't even related to bears.
        The koala is related to the kangaroo and the wombat. The koala is a marsupial mammal.
        The reason the koala is called a koala bear is because the koala looks like a teddy bear.</p>
        
        <p>The koala's scientific name is Phasclarctos Cinereus.</p>
        
        <p>Now there are only 2,000 to 8,000 koalas in the wild! Although not officially classified as endangered, the population of Australian koalas has dropped by 90% in less than a decade. This is due to the destruction of the koala's natural habitat,
        a narrow crescent on the eastern coast of Australia.</p>
